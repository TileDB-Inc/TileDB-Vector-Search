# feature-vector-prototype
Directory for prototyping feature vector / similarity search.  

There are two driver programs in `experimental/src` : `flat.cc` and `ivf_hack.cc`, which do exact-flat and kmeans-flat searches, respectively.

Documentation for these driver programs can be found in `experimental/src/README.md`.
