In this section I will describe how to perform serverless, distributed ingestion and vector search using TileDB Cloud’s task graphs. I will also cover the exciting data governance functionality of TileDB Cloud, which allows you to securely share your assets with other users, discover other users’ public work and log every action for auditing purposes.\n","\n","If you are interested in delving into the general functionality of TileDB Cloud, you can read the following blog posts:\n","\n","* [Getting Started with TileDB Cloud in &lt;4 Minutes](https://tiledb.com/blog/getting-started-with-tiledb-cloud-in-less-than-4-minutes)\n","* [TileDB Cloud: Notebooks](https://tiledb.com/blog/tiledb-cloud-notebooks)\n","* [TileDB Cloud: User-defined Functions](https://tiledb.com/blog/tiledb-cloud-user-defined-functions)\n","* [TileDB Cloud: Task Graphs](https://tiledb.com/blog/tiledb-cloud-task-graphs)\n","\n","## Scaling with serverless, distributed task graphs\n","\n","**Distributed ingestion** can greatly speed up and horizontally scale out the ingestion of vectors. In this example, we've ingested the SIFT 1 Billion vector dataset using the `IVF_FLAT` index (which involved computing K-means, a computationally intensive operation) in 46 minutes for a total cost of $11.385 in TileDB Cloud. \n","\n","To ingest in a distributed, parallel fashion, simply set the `mode` to \"`BATCH`\" for batch ingestion, and pass a `tiledb.cloud.Config()` parameter with your TileDB credentials:\n","\n","```python\n","import tiledb\n","import tiledb.cloud\n","import tiledb.vector_search as vs\n","\n","output_uri = \"tiledb://TileDB-Inc/s3://tiledb-exaxmple/vector-search/ann_sift1b\"\n","source_uri = \"tiledb://TileDB-Inc/6a9a8e97-d99c-4ddb-829a-8455c794906e\"\n","\n","vs.ingest(    \n","    index_type = \"IVF_FLAT\",\n","    index_uri = output_uri,\n","    source_uri = source_uri,\n","    source_type = \"TILEDB_ARRAY\",\n","    partitions = 10_000,\n","    config = tiledb.cloud.Config(),\n","    mode = vs.Mode.BATCH)\n","```\n","\n","Note that `ingest` automatically calculates the number of workers that will work in parallel to perform the ingestion, and there is no need to spin up any cluster - _everything is serverless!_\n","\n","TileDB Cloud records all the details about the task graph, and lets you monitor it in real time.\n","\n","[![image01-task-graph monitor.png](https://d2y9znfg8p5aha.cloudfront.net/cms/image01_task_graph_monitor_1ea74b888f.png)](https://d2y9znfg8p5aha.cloudfront.net/cms/image01_task_graph_monitor_1ea74b888f.png)\n","\n","**Distributed queries** give you the capability of performing higher throughput queries with lower latency, yielding a much higher QPS. For example, in the example below we are able to submit a batch of 1000 query vectors to the 1 billion vector dataset for a cost of $0.10 in 23 seconds.  \n","\n","Performing a distributed query is similar to the ingestion described above, but now you can set mode to `REALTIME` as it will be faster:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# If running locally, log in to TileDB Cloud\n","import os\n","\n","tiledb.cloud.login(token=os.getenv(\"TILEDB_REST_TOKEN\"))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([[633840422, 683459400, 528266068, 109873774, 608153831, 825146167,\n","        762300501,  17551325, 630237822, 725616074],\n","       [335599671, 335599264, 335598977,  83311229, 682619471, 335599256,\n","        963017701, 335598760, 335599580, 335599807],\n","       [344643354, 246955639, 565542048, 751698684,  87364602, 840645909,\n","        550511822, 516688312, 668831661, 734216921],\n","       [186438378,  85244399, 384823375, 835264423, 446357863, 322140940,\n","        171195744, 857829688, 533547710, 463570876],\n","       [523076231,  83960482, 608028818, 487961680,  33024749,  85317553,\n","        136475748, 924522023, 684614270, 896442333],\n","       [786435621, 537081045, 152994050,  79006238, 280302530, 754967657,\n","        463050981, 999108052, 795662422, 739423679],\n","       [523602814, 937670694, 850429385, 207670705, 446595472, 158341966,\n","        122737998, 886060311, 567862264, 766553033],\n","       [121442525,  61428470, 704654443, 464551106, 107542667,  67712460,\n","        215032073, 392963508, 393167401, 786537659],\n","       [709902297, 177784551, 709901802, 341502248, 966314308, 954738556,\n","        379171101, 678438996, 183207959, 777843604],\n","       [784691349, 792459314, 999968647, 546321803, 373953455, 576271723,\n","        439045612, 870296355, 589322721, 553658041]], dtype=uint64)"]},"execution_count":16,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["uri = \"tiledb://TileDB-Inc/ann_sift1b\"\n","query_vector_uri = \"tiledb://TileDB-Inc/bigann_1b_ground_truth_query\"\n","n_vectors=10\n","\n","index = vs.IVFFlatIndex(uri, config=tiledb.cloud.Config(), memory_budget=10)\n","query_vectors=np.transpose(vs.load_as_array(query_vector_uri, config=tiledb.cloud.Config()).astype(np.float32))[0:n_vectors]\n","result_d, result_i = index.query(query_vectors, k=10, nprobe=1, mode=tiledb.cloud.dag.Mode.REALTIME, num_partitions=20)\n","result_i[0:10]"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Vector search asset `tiledb://TileDB-Inc/ann_sift1b` is public (see “Governance” section below) and, thus, the above code will “just work” if you try to use it with your credentials.\n","\n","Here is the task graph output of the above query.\n","\n","[![image02-distributed-query-vector-search.png](https://d2y9znfg8p5aha.cloudfront.net/cms/image02_distributed_query_vector_search_553c476d66.png)](https://d2y9znfg8p5aha.cloudfront.net/cms/image02_distributed_query_vector_search_553c476d66.png)\n","\n","## Governance\n","\n","TileDB Cloud allows you to quickly explore any vector search datasets right in the UI.
