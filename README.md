# TileDB Vector Search

*TileDB-Vector-Search* is a C++ library and Python API for vector search built on top of the [TileDB Storage Engine](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB).

Please see the following blog posts for background:

* [Why TileDB as a Vector Database](https://tiledb.com/blog/why-tiledb-as-a-vector-database)
* [TileDB Vector Search 101](https://tiledb.com/blog/tiledb-101-vector-search/)

We have released a [LangChain integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/tiledb), with others to come soon.
