 Basic nn-search algorithm

1. Choose a starting node in the graph (potentially randomly) as a candidate
node
2. Look at all nodes connected by an edge to the best untried candidate node in
the graph
3. Add all these nodes to our potential candidate pool
4. Sort the candidate pool by closeness / similarity to the query point
5. Truncate the pool to ùëò best (as in closest to the query) candidates
6. Return to step 2, unless we have already tried all the candidates in the pool

/*
    NN-descent algorithm
    1. Start with a random graph (connect each node to ùëò random nodes)
    2. For each node:
    3. Measure the distance from the node to the neighbors of its neighbors
    4. If any are closer, then update the graph accordingly, and keep only the ùëò closest
    5. If any updates were made to the graph then go back to step 2, otherwise stop
