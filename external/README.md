### TODO:

* Set up git submodules for
  * milvus
  * faiss
  * others?  (do we want submodules for external packages we depend on, or should that just be fetchcontent?)
  

* Create subdirectory for data
  * define policy and mechanism for fetching datasets
    * should have original and array?
    * Just array?
    * ingestion code here too?
